# Urbalurba Presentation System

> *"Stop wasting time on how your presentation looks. Spend time on what you know - your subject."*

A presentation framework that transforms how you create professional presentations. **You focus on your expertise and content, AI handles all the design decisions and creates stunning presentations that follow best practices for conveying your message.**

## üß† Your Knowledge + AI = Professional Results

**Important:** This system doesn't generate content for you. **YOU provide the expertise, knowledge, and ideas.** The AI simply takes your raw content (workshop notes, bullet points, research findings) and transforms it into professionally structured slides with optimal design patterns.

**You're the expert. AI is your presentation designer.**

## ‚ú® What This System Does

**Transforms presentation creation from complex design work to pure content focus:**

- ü§ñ **AI Organizes Your Content** - You provide the knowledge, AI handles structure and design decisions
- üé® **Best Practice Layouts Automatically Applied** - Proven patterns for maximum message impact
- üè¢ **Professional Branding Built-In** - Currently supports Norwegian Red Cross, expanding to more organizations
- üöÄ **15+ Presentation Patterns** - Title slides, data visualization, storytelling, technical content, and more  
- üì± **Multiple Output Formats** - HTML, PDF, and PowerPoint presentations that work perfectly on any device
- üß† **Message-Focused Design** - Every layout optimized for clear communication and audience engagement
- ü§ñ **AI Loves text** - AI is built into vscode and will help you write.
- üîì **presentation is not locked into a specific tool** - Just as in free speech, your text should not be locked into a proprietary format that someone else controls.

## üìã Example Presentation Output
From simple markdown notes to presentation in 3 formats:

- **HTML** - [Interactive web presentation with speaker notes](https://terchris.github.io/urbalurba-present/examples/red-cross-example-presentation.html)
- **PDF** - [Print-ready format for handouts and documentation](https://terchris.github.io/urbalurba-present/examples/red-cross-example-presentation.pdf)
- **PowerPoint** - [Editable slides for Microsoft PowerPoint](https://github.com/terchris/urbalurba-present/raw/main/examples/red-cross-example-presentation.pptx)

The presentation content / the text is in a simple markdown file, which you can edit in any text editor. **Source:** [`red-cross-example-presentation.md`](red-cross-example-presentation.md)

1. **üìù You Provide Your Expertise** ‚Üí Add your knowledge, research, and ideas to `presentation-input.md` (workshop notes, bullet points, findings, etc.)
2. **ü§ñ AI Structures Your Content** ‚Üí AI reads your expertise + organization settings, generates `my-presentation.md` with professional slide layouts and design patterns
3. **‚úèÔ∏è You Refine & Iterate** ‚Üí Edit `my-presentation.md` like working in PowerPoint - modify content, reorder slides, adjust messaging. Export anytime to see results
4. **üé® System Generates Output** ‚Üí Convert to HTML, PDF, or PowerPoint with perfect branding and professional design

### The Magic:
- **You provide the expertise** - Your knowledge, research findings, and ideas are the foundation
- **AI organizes professionally** - Optimal layouts for each content type (stats ‚Üí data visualization, stories ‚Üí image layouts, etc.)
- **You maintain full control** to edit, iterate, and perfect your presentation
- **Instant preview** by exporting during your editing process
- **Automatic brand compliance** using your organization's colors, fonts, and imagery built into every design pattern

## üöÄ Quick Start

### 1. Install the System

**Mac/Linux:**
```bash
curl -L $(curl -s https://api.github.com/repos/terchris/urbalurba-present/releases/latest | grep "browser_download_url.*urbalurba-present.zip" | cut -d '"' -f 4) -o urbalurba-present.zip && unzip urbalurba-present.zip -d urbalurba-present && rm urbalurba-present.zip && ./urbalurba-present/initiate.sh
```

**Windows (PowerShell):**
```powershell
$url = (Invoke-RestMethod "https://api.github.com/repos/terchris/urbalurba-present/releases/latest").assets | Where-Object {$_.name -eq "urbalurba-present.zip"} | Select-Object -ExpandProperty browser_download_url
Invoke-WebRequest -Uri $url -OutFile "urbalurba-present.zip"
Expand-Archive -Path "urbalurba-present.zip" -DestinationPath "." -Force
Remove-Item "urbalurba-present.zip"
.\urbalurba-present\initiate.bat
```

**What this one command does:**
- Downloads the latest Urbalurba system
- Extracts it to `urbalurba-present/` folder
- Runs the setup script automatically
- Copies `template-settings.md` to your project root
- Creates a starter `presentation-input.md` file
- Sets up VS Code settings for Marp

You'll see output like:
```
üöÄ Initiating Urbalurba Presentation System...
üìÑ Copying template-settings.md...
üìù Creating presentation-input.md...
‚öôÔ∏è  Setting up VS Code configuration...
üéâ Setup complete! Your project is ready.
```

### 2. Open VS Code and Edit Your Files
```bash
# Open VS Code in your project
code .
```

**Edit these files in VS Code:**
- **`template-settings.md`** - Configure your organization (name, website, logo, theme)
- **`presentation-input.md`** - Add your presentation content and ideas

**Available themes to choose from (use just the name):**
- `red-cross-1-theme` (Humanitarian/NGO)
- `cnn-theme` (Media/News)
- `dnb-bank-theme` (Financial/Corporate)
- `un-theme` (International/Diplomatic)

The `initiate.sh` script creates a starter file with this structure:
```markdown
# My Presentation Ideas

## Main Topics
- Add your main presentation topics here
- Key messages you want to convey
- Important statistics or data points

## Call to Action
- What do you want your audience to do?
- Next steps for engagement
```

### 3. AI Creates Initial Structure

```bash
claude code
````

At the prompt type:

```plaintext
I need you to create a presentation. Please start by reading urbalurba-present/ai-instructions.md and following those instructions exactly.
```

>Claude will automatically read your files and create my-presentation.md

### 4. Edit & Iterate Your Presentation

Edit `my-presentation.md` in VS Code to refine your presentation. You can:
- Modify content directly in the markdown file
- Reorder slides by moving sections around
- Adjust messaging and add details as needed
- Export to preview results (see the [howto guide](doc/howto.md) for details)
