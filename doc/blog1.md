# From Post-it Notes to Professional Presentations: How AI Became My Design Partner

*Finally, a way to focus on what you know best — your subject — instead of wrestling with slide layouts*

---

Have you ever found yourself staring at a blank PowerPoint slide, knowing exactly what you want to say but having no idea how to make it look professional? That's been my story for years. I'd have decent ideas from workshops with colleagues, walls covered in colorful post-it notes, and some knowledge to share. But somehow, between my brain and the final presentation, everything would fall apart.

I bet you've been there too.

## The Design Trap That Catches Us All

This is what used to happen: I'd open PowerPoint, get immediately overwhelmed by all the design choices, and spend hours moving text boxes around instead of focusing on my message. Honestly, I've probably wasted weeks of my life doing this. I'd overload slides with bullet points, use too many colors, and end up with presentations that looked like a rainbow threw up on my screen.

The problem wasn't my content — I had something to say. The problem was that traditional presentation tools force you to think about design from the very first slide. Before you can even organize your thoughts, you're already choosing fonts, colors, and layouts. It's like being asked to paint a masterpiece when all you want to do is write a letter.

## The Workshop Wall Revelation

Just last week, I organized a workshop with some colleagues. We did that classic brainstorming thing — post-it notes on the wall, everyone throwing out ideas in a creative session. By the end, we had quite a few useful insights covering an entire wall.

Then came the dreaded question: "So... who's making the presentation?"

That's when I had an idea. I took a photo of our post-it wall and uploaded it to ChatGPT, asking it to transcribe everything. Then I took that transcribed text, added my own thoughts, and organized it using Markdown — just plain text with simple formatting.

But you know what I realized? Even with all my content organized, I still faced the same old problem. Too many bullet points per slide, no clear visual hierarchy, and the looming dread of having to make it all look professional.

## Discovering the Patterns Behind Great Presentations

Instead of diving into design mode (and inevitable frustration), my brain did what it does best — it started solving a different problem. I began wondering: surely there are patterns to good presentation design? Maybe I could figure out the rules that professional designers follow?

So I started obsessively analyzing presentation layouts online (with some help from AI, because why make it harder than it needs to be). It turns out there really aren't that many different patterns you need. Each pattern serves a specific purpose:

- **Two-column layouts** work great for comparisons or before/after scenarios
- **Statistics slides** need visual emphasis on the numbers
- **Storytelling slides** combine images with minimal text
- **Call-to-action slides** organize next steps into clear grids

I put together about 15 different patterns - well, maybe closer to 12 really useful ones - that seem to cover most presentation needs. But I still didn't know how to apply these patterns to my own messy content.

## Enter AI: My Presentation Design Partner

That's when something clicked. Actually, it was more like a slow realization over a few days of procrastination. What if AI could take my raw content and automatically fit it into these patterns? Not generate the content for me (I know my subject), but organize and design it professionally?

So I built exactly that. Well, "built" is probably too strong a word - I put together a system that works.

I created something I call the [Urbalurba Presentation System](https://github.com/terchris/urbalurba-present) — a workflow where:

1. **You provide your content** — Your workshop notes, bullet points, research findings, whatever you've got
2. **AI structures it** — Automatically selects the right patterns and organizes everything
3. **You refine and iterate** — Edit the result like you would in PowerPoint, but with better structure
4. **The system generates output** — HTML, PDF, or PowerPoint formats with consistent branding

## The Magic of Iteration

Here's what I find useful: I can run the AI multiple times on the same content and get slightly different results each time. It's like having someone help me explore different ways to present the same ideas. Sometimes the AI will emphasize statistics, other times it might focus more on storytelling — each iteration shows me something new about my own content.

## What This Actually Looks Like

Want to see how this actually works? I cant show you the presentation as thats internal info, but i fetched info from the Norwegian Red Cross website and handed it to the AI.
Here's what the AI created: a  professional presentation in 3 formats: [PDF](https://terchris.github.io/urbalurba-present/examples/red-cross-example-presentation.pdf) / [PowerPoint](https://github.com/terchris/urbalurba-present/raw/main/examples/red-cross-example-presentation.pptx) / [HTML](https://terchris.github.io/urbalurba-present/examples/red-cross-example-presentation.html) with proper slide layouts, consistent branding, and clear visual hierarchy. The HTML version even has speaker notes for each slide, making it easy to present without having to memorize everything.

The AI took my input and turned them into slides that make sense. Two-column comparisons for before/after scenarios, statistics slides with proper visual emphasis, and storytelling slides that don't look like they were created by an designer (which they weren't).

## The Bigger Picture

This isn't just about making prettier slides. It's about removing the friction between having expertise and sharing it effectively. When you don't have to worry about whether your slide looks professional, you can focus entirely on crafting your message.

I've been struggling with presentations for years, but only recently started using AI to help. This approach has changed how I think about presentations. Instead of dreading the design process, I can focus on organizing my thoughts. It's like having a kollega who actually knows design helping you out - without having to admit to them how bad you are at making things look good.

## Try It Yourself

If this might be useful for you, the system is available on GitHub: [urbalurba-present](https://github.com/terchris/urbalurba-present). The setup takes about 5 minutes, and you can focus on your content while AI handles the organizing and designing.

You know your subject. You shouldn't have to become an expert on slide design too.
