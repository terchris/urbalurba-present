- üöÄ **15+ Presentation Patterns** - Title slides, data visualization, storytelling, technical content, and more  
- üì± **Multiple Output Formats** - HTML, PDF, and PowerPoint presentations that work perfectly on any device
- üß† **Message-Focused Design** - Every layout optimized for clear communication and audience engagement
- ü§ñ **AI Loves text** - AI is built into vscode and will help you write.
- üîì **presentation is not locked into a specific tool** - Just as in free speech, your text should not be locked into a proprietary format that someone else controls.

## üéØ Key Benefits

## üîß How It Works

### Simple 4-Step Process:

1. **üìù You Provide Content** ‚Üí Create `presentation-input.md` with your workshop notes, bullet points, or any raw text describing your presentation
2. **ü§ñ AI Creates Initial Structure** ‚Üí AI reads your content + organization settings, generates `my-presentation.md` with suggested slide layouts and design patterns
3. **‚úèÔ∏è You Refine & Iterate** ‚Üí Edit `my-presentation.md` like working in PowerPoint - modify content, reorder slides, adjust messaging. Export anytime to see results
4. **üé® System Generates Output** ‚Üí Convert to HTML, PDF, or PowerPoint with perfect branding and professional design

### The Magic:
- **AI gives you a smart starting point** with optimal layouts for each content type (stats ‚Üí data visualization, stories ‚Üí image layouts, etc.)
- **You maintain full control** to edit, iterate, and perfect your presentation
- **Instant preview** by exporting during your editing process
- **Automatic brand compliance** using your organization's colors, fonts, and imagery built into every design pattern

## üöÄ Quick Start

### 1. Install the System

**Mac/Linux:**
```bash
curl -L $(curl -s https://api.github.com/repos/terchris/urbalurba-present/releases/latest | grep "browser_download_url.*urbalurba-present.zip" | cut -d '"' -f 4) -o urbalurba-present.zip && unzip urbalurba-present.zip -d urbalurba-present && rm urbalurba-present.zip
```

**Windows (PowerShell):**
```powershell
$url = (Invoke-RestMethod "https://api.github.com/repos/terchris/urbalurba-present/releases/latest").assets | Where-Object {$_.name -eq "urbalurba-present.zip"} | Select-Object -ExpandProperty browser_download_url
Invoke-WebRequest -Uri $url -OutFile "urbalurba-present.zip"
Expand-Archive -Path "urbalurba-present.zip" -DestinationPath "." -Force
Remove-Item "urbalurba-present.zip"
```

**What you get:**
- `template-settings.md` - Configure for your organization  
- `ai-instructions.md` - Simple instructions for Claude Code
- `ai-design-template.md` - Detailed design patterns and specifications
- `red-cross-1-theme.css` - Norwegian Red Cross visual theme
- `red-cross-example-presentation.md` - Complete working example

### 2. Configure Your Organization Settings
```bash
# Edit the template settings for your organization
# Replace Norwegian Red Cross settings with your own
edit urbalurba-present/template-settings.md

# Update: organization name, website, logo, images, videos, theme file
# This tells AI what branding and media to use in your presentations
```

### 3. Create Your Content Input
```bash
# Create your content input file with your raw material
# Add your workshop notes, bullet points, or any text describing your presentation
```

**Example content for `presentation-input.md`:**
```markdown
# My Presentation Ideas
- Main topic: Digital transformation
- Key statistics: 95% efficiency improvement
- Three main benefits: speed, quality, compliance
- Call to action: pilot program
```

**The important thing is to create the `presentation-input.md` file with your actual content.**

### 4. AI Creates Initial Structure

```bash
claude code
````

At the prompt type:

```plaintext
Please read and follow ai-instructions.md
```

>Claude will automatically read your files and create my-presentation.md

### 5. Edit & Iterate Your Presentation

Open vscode in the project root:

```bash
code .
```

Edit `my-presentation.md` to refine your presentation. You can:
- Modify content directly in the markdown file
- Reorder slides by moving sections around
- Adjust messaging and add details as needed
- Export to preview results (se the [howto guide](howto/howto.md) for details)
