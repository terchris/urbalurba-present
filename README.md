- üè¢ **Professional Branding Built-In** - Currently supports Norwegian Red Cross, expanding to more organizations
- üöÄ **15+ Presentation Patterns** - Title slides, data visualization, storytelling, technical content, and more  
- üì± **Multiple Output Formats** - HTML, PDF, and PowerPoint presentations that work perfectly on any device
- üß† **Message-Focused Design** - Every layout optimized for clear communication and audience engagement
- ü§ñ **AI Loves text** - AI is built into vscode and will help you write.
- üîì **presentation is not locked into a specific tool** - Just as in free speech, your text should not be locked into a proprietary format that someone else controls.

## üéØ Key Benefits

## üîß How It Works

### Simple 4-Step Process:

1. **üìù You Provide Content** ‚Üí Create `presentation-input.md` with your workshop notes, bullet points, or any raw text describing your presentation
2. **ü§ñ AI Creates Initial Structure** ‚Üí AI reads your content + organization settings, generates `my-presentation.md` with suggested slide layouts and design patterns
3. **‚úèÔ∏è You Refine & Iterate** ‚Üí Edit `my-presentation.md` like working in PowerPoint - modify content, reorder slides, adjust messaging. Export anytime to see results
4. **üé® System Generates Output** ‚Üí Convert to HTML, PDF, or PowerPoint with perfect branding and professional design

### The Magic:
- **AI gives you a smart starting point** with optimal layouts for each content type (stats ‚Üí data visualization, stories ‚Üí image layouts, etc.)
- **You maintain full control** to edit, iterate, and perfect your presentation
- **Instant preview** by exporting during your editing process
- **Automatic brand compliance** using your organization's colors, fonts, and imagery built into every design pattern

## üöÄ Quick Start

### 1. Install the System

**Mac/Linux:**
```bash
curl -L $(curl -s https://api.github.com/repos/terchris/urbalurba-present/releases/latest | grep "browser_download_url.*urbalurba-present.zip" | cut -d '"' -f 4) -o urbalurba-present.zip && unzip urbalurba-present.zip -d urbalurba-present && rm urbalurba-present.zip
```

**Windows (PowerShell):**
```powershell
$url = (Invoke-RestMethod "https://api.github.com/repos/terchris/urbalurba-present/releases/latest").assets | Where-Object {$_.name -eq "urbalurba-present.zip"} | Select-Object -ExpandProperty browser_download_url
Invoke-WebRequest -Uri $url -OutFile "urbalurba-present.zip"
Expand-Archive -Path "urbalurba-present.zip" -DestinationPath "." -Force
Remove-Item "urbalurba-present.zip"
```

**What you get:**
- `initiate.sh` - Automated setup script
- `template-settings.md` - Organization configuration template
- `ai-instructions.md` - Simple instructions for Claude Code
- `ai-design-template.md` - Detailed design patterns and specifications
- `themes/` - Multiple visual themes (Red Cross, CNN, DNB Bank, UN)
- `red-cross-example-presentation.md` - Complete working example

### 2. Initialize Your Project
```bash
# Run the setup script to copy files and configure VS Code
./urbalurba-present/initiate.sh
```

This script will:
- Copy `template-settings.md` to your project root
- Create a starter `presentation-input.md` file
- Set up VS Code settings for Marp

### 3. Open VS Code and Edit Your Files
```bash
# Open VS Code in your project
code .
```

**Edit these files in VS Code:**
- **`template-settings.md`** - Configure your organization (name, website, logo, theme)
- **`presentation-input.md`** - Add your presentation content and ideas

**Available themes to choose from:**
- `urbalurba-present/themes/red-cross-1-theme.css` (Humanitarian/NGO)
- `urbalurba-present/themes/cnn-theme.css` (Media/News)
- `urbalurba-present/themes/dnb-bank-theme.css` (Financial/Corporate)
- `urbalurba-present/themes/un-theme.css` (International/Diplomatic)

The `initiate.sh` script creates a starter file with this structure:
```markdown
# My Presentation Ideas

## Main Topics
- Add your main presentation topics here
- Key messages you want to convey
- Important statistics or data points

## Call to Action
- What do you want your audience to do?
- Next steps for engagement
```

### 4. AI Creates Initial Structure

```bash
claude code
````

At the prompt type:

```plaintext
Please read and follow urbalurba-present/ai-instructions.md
```

>Claude will automatically read your files and create my-presentation.md

### 5. Edit & Iterate Your Presentation

Edit `my-presentation.md` in VS Code to refine your presentation. You can:
- Modify content directly in the markdown file
- Reorder slides by moving sections around
- Adjust messaging and add details as needed
- Export to preview results (see the [howto guide](https://github.com/terchris/urbalurba-present/blob/main/howto/howto.md) for details)
