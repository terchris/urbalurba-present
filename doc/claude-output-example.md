# Example output from Claude code 

This is an example of what happens whan you start claud code and you tell claude code to:
`I need you to create a presentation. Please start by reading urbalurba-present/ai-instructions.md and following those instructions exactly.`

You will get slightly different results each time you run the command. This is because Claude Code uses AI to generate the presentation, and it has its own way of interpreting the instructions and the input files.

Its like giving the same task to a human, and you will get different results from different people, even if they follow the same instructions.

## First run with the input in `presentation-input.md`

 Tips for getting started:

 1. Run /init to create a CLAUDE.md file with instructions for Claude
 2. Use Claude to help with file analysis, editing, bash commands and git
 3. Be as specific as you would with another engineer for the best results
 4. ✔ Run /terminal-setup to set up terminal integration

⏺ I'm ready to help you with your code and software engineering tasks. What would you like me to work on?

> I need you to create a presentation. Please start by reading urbalurba-present/ai-instructions.md and following
   those instructions exactly.

⏺ I'll read the AI instructions file and follow them exactly to create your presentation.

⏺ Read(urbalurba-present/ai-instructions.md)
  ⎿  Read 96 lines (ctrl+r to expand)

⏺ Now I'll read the input files to understand the content and settings:

⏺ Read(presentation-input.md)
  ⎿  Read 387 lines (ctrl+r to expand)

⏺ Read(template-settings.md)
  ⎿  Read 41 lines (ctrl+r to expand)

⏺ Read(urbalurba-present/ai-design-template.md)
  ⎿  Read 452 lines (ctrl+r to expand)

⏺ Now I'll create a todo list and start building the presentation following the AI instructions:
  ⎿  ☐ Analyze presentation-input.md content and identify main topics
     ☐ Choose appropriate design patterns for each slide based on content type
     ☐ Create Marp frontmatter with Norwegian Red Cross theme settings
     ☐ Create all slides with proper HTML structure and design patterns
     ☐ Add meaningful speaker notes for complex slides
     ☐ Review for word limits, heading hierarchy, and design consistency

⏺ Content Analysis Complete: The presentation covers building a "Kompetansenettverk" (competency network) to
  connect scattered technical expertise across Norwegian Red Cross departments. Main themes include transforming
  departmental silos into collaborative solutions, cost savings from reduced external consulting, and talent
  retention benefits.

## Second run with the same input

If you rename the my-presentation.md file to my-presentation-2.md else, and run the same command again, you will get a new presentation my-presentation.md based on the same content, but with different design patterns and layout.
